# ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
- Detect deepfake videos using face crops + ResNet18
- Explain predictions with Grad-CAM

---

# ðŸ”‘ Pipeline
Video â†’ Frames â†’ Face Detection â†’ ResNet18 â†’ Aggregation â†’ Prediction

- Input: short MP4
- Output: real vs fake probability
- Threshold = 0.7 for fake

---

# ðŸ“Š Results & Explainability
- Validation Accuracy: **97%**
- Video-level classification correct on test set
- Grad-CAM focuses on **face artifacts** (eyes, mouth)
